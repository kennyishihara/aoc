# AOC 2024 Solution in Rust

Rust is increasing in popularity and I've always wanted to learn it, so
I'll be using Rust for 2024 AOC. I will use the most simple approaches in
solving the problems instead of using insane hacks like I've seen online.

Feel free to leave feedback on my noobie Rust code!

## How to run

```bash
cargo run
```

and enter the day (e.g. "1") and the part (e.g. "2").
